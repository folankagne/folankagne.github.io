I’m Folan [Cayo Chalance] Kagné, of Belgian and Cameroonian origin. I am a first-year PhD student at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and the [Doctoral School of Economics Panthéon-Sorbonne (EPS)](https://ed-economie.pantheonsorbonne.fr/), working under the supervision of [Camille Hémet](https://sites.google.com/site/camillehemet/). 

Previously, I completed a Master’s in Economics and Psychology at the Paris School of Economics, co-accredited by [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/) and [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), where I specialized in the intersection of economic theory and psychological sciences.

## Research interests
- Behavioral and Experimental Economics  
- Social Psychology (identity, exclusion, social norms)  
- Economics of Crime  
- Law and Economics  

## Beyond economics
I am deeply interested in philosophy, psychology, sociology, literature, political science, and the arts, with a particular passion for music — especially rap and jazz.
