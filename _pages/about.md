# About me

I’m Folan [Cayo Chalance] Kagné, a PhD student at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/), of Belgian and Cameroonian origin.  

I work under the supervision of [Camille Hémet](https://sites.google.com/site/camillehemet/).  

Previously, I completed a Master’s at PSE, [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/), and [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/), specializing in Economics and Psychology.  



## Research interests
- Behavioral and Experimental Economics  
- Social Psychology (identity, exclusion, social norms)  
- Economics of Crime  
- Law and Economics  



## Beyond economics
I am deeply interested in philosophy, sociology, literature, political science, and the arts, with a particular passion for music — especially rap and jazz.
