- Starting my PhD journey at PSE, working on the dynamics of exclusion and inclusion in prisons, and engaging in my first year of coursework and seminars.  

- Finishing early drafts of [working projects](/research/) (and plenty of [marginalia](/year-archive/)) on the philosophy of race and mass incarceration — always happy to discuss these ideas.  

- Currently based in Paris — most likely at the Jourdan campus [R4-57], in a library in the 5th, or scribbling notes in a PMU.
