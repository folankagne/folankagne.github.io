- Starting my PhD journey at the [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/), working on the dynamics of exclusion and inclusion in prisons.  

- Finishing early drafts of [working projects](/projects/) (and plenty of [marginalia](/year-archive/)) on the philosophy of race and mass incarceration — always happy to discuss these ideas.  

- Engaging in my first semester of coursework and seminars.  

- Currently based in Paris, most likely in a library in the 5th arrondissement or scribbling notes in a PMU in Bagneux.
