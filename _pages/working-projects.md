## Philosophical Foundations: Racial Realism, Black Male Studies, and the Dehumanization of Black Men

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

This chapter examines the philosophical foundations of Black Male Studies, as developed by Tommy Curry, and its relevance to understanding the dehumanization and marginalization of Black men, particularly within carceral settings. Curry’s work emphasizes the unique vulnerabilities faced by Black men due to their historical and social exclusion from dominant gender and race theories. Critiquing mainstream feminist and racial frameworks, Curry highlights the brutal realities Black men endure, including systemic violence, poverty, sexual exploitation, and exclusion from socio-political structures. Building on racial realism, particularly as articulated by Derrick Bell, the chapter explores how Black men have been historically constructed as threats—physically, economically, and sexually—resulting in their heightened dehumanization in prison systems. Curry’s analysis of the sexualized fear and desire surrounding the Black male body, including the construction of the Black Male Rapist trope, offers a critical lens to understand the homoeroticization of Black male flesh and its violent consequences, such as assault and death. <br><br>


Frantz Fanon’s foundational concepts, including the phobogenic object and the psychological effects of colonization, complement Curry’s work by exploring how colonial frameworks perpetuate the fear and alienation of Black male bodies. These insights illuminate the intersection of racialized masculinity, systemic oppression, and the carceral environment, where Black men’s identities are shaped by simultaneous fear and desire. <br><br>  


Norman Ajari’s contributions further enrich the chapter’s analysis by addressing the existential dimensions of Black male suffering. Ajari’s exploration of the “racial unconscious” within Western philosophy situates Black men in an existential liminality between life and death, highlighting how dehumanization transcends physical violence to affect their very being. His reflections on Black radical pessimism, particularly as developed in Noirceur (2022), reveal how the carceral system perpetuates historical anti-Blackness, reinforcing the conditions that render Black men perpetual outsiders.  <br><br>


Together, the works of Curry, Fanon, and Ajari provide a comprehensive philosophical framework for understanding the structural, psychological, and existential dimensions of Black male dehumanization. This chapter situates these critical perspectives within carceral systems, offering a nuanced analysis of the profound challenges faced by Black male prisoners under systemic oppression. <br><br>

## Social Cooperation and Exclusion in Carceral Environments: The Role of Identity and Exclusion in Shaping Prisoner Cooperation

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

This research project explores the dynamics of social exclusion and social identity within carceral settings, building on preliminary findings from my Master’s thesis. Those findings demonstrated that social exclusion tends to reduce cooperative behaviors in public goods games but that this effect can be mitigated by strong group identification and an internal locus of control. The project seeks to examine how these psychological mechanisms influence cooperative behaviors in prisons, an environment where cooperation is crucial but often difficult to sustain. <br><br>

This study is situated within a broader theoretical framework drawing on key contributions from Michel Foucault, Erving Goffman, and Didier Fassin. Foucault’s Discipline and Punish conceptualizes the prison as a mechanism of social control, reflecting and reproducing broader societal power dynamics through disciplinary logics and surveillance. Goffman’s concept of the “total institution” emphasizes the psychological impact of rigid, authoritarian spaces where inmates are stripped of their identities and reduced to their institutional roles. Didier Fassin offers a complementary perspective, grounding his analysis in the subjective and emotional experiences of prisoners. His ethnographic work highlights the complex interplay of human suffering, social interactions, and the porous boundaries between carceral institutions and the outside world. Together, these frameworks inform the study’s approach to understanding how prisons operate as social microcosms that simultaneously isolate and regulate individuals.<br><br>

The aim is to deepen our understanding of these processes to propose potentially innovative interventions that promote cooperation and reduce antisocial behaviors, ultimately contributing to the reintegration of inmates and the reduction of recidivism. Complementary research avenues include examining the impact of group dynamics and social identity management on prosocial behaviors within prisons, as well as the effects of social inclusion on inmate rehabilitation.<br><br>

By integrating insights from social psychology, sociology, economics, and philosophy, this project contributes both theoretically and practically to the understanding of reintegration challenges in the French penitentiary system. Through its focus on the intersection of psychological and social mechanisms, it aspires to offer actionable recommendations for fostering cooperation and improving outcomes for incarcerated individuals.<br><br>

## Beyond Exclusion: Understanding the Complexities of Social Identity and Provision of Public Goods in Experimental Settings

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

This research explores the impact of social exclusion and social identity on cooperation through a three-stage experimental design. In the early stages, participants established their group identity on the basis of their preferences for abstract paintings. The first experimental stage involved symmetrical and asymmetrical one- shot prisoner’s dilemma (PD) games, revealing that cooperation rates were higher in the asymmetrical PD, despite the unchanged Nash equilibrium favoring defection. The concept of the “veil of ignorance” could explain this increased cooperation, by promoting empathy between participants. The second experimental stage, a public goods game, showed that prior social exclusion led to lower contributions, but that strong group identification and internal locus of control mitigated this effect, leading to some increased contributions from the socially excluded individuals. These results highlight the complexity of social exclusion and the important roles of social identity and individual characteristics in cooperative behavior. They pave the way for future field experiments, which should investigate the interaction between these factors to inform policies promoting social cohesion and prosocial behavior.<br><br>

## Black Masculinity Under Surveillance: Fanon, Anti-Blackness, and the Global Dynamics of Mass Incarceration

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

This paper examines mass incarceration’s disproportionate impact on Black males through a Fanonian lens, highlighting the persistence of colonial legacies in modern carceral systems. By comparing the U.S. and French prison systems, it exposes how systemic racism, racial capitalism, and the libidinal economy of anti-Blackness sustain the criminalization and dehumanization of Black men, emphasizing the need for decolonial approaches to justice.

## Philosophies et langues africaines, une introduction

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>

Cet essai explore les idées d'Alexis Kagamé sur la philosophie bantoue, mettant en avant son approche linguistique. Il remet en question les généralisations de Placide Tempels, soulignant l'importance du langage dans la pensée philosophique africaine. En examinant les liens entre langage et pensée, il invite à repenser les fondements de cette philosophie. L'essai aborde également les perspectives de Souleymane Bachir Diagne, qui encourage à dépasser les nationalismes ontologiques et linguistiques pour embrasser la diversité philosophique et linguistique. Ensuite, il analyse la conception du temps chez John Mbiti, montrant comment la langue et la culture influencent la perception du temps en Afrique. Enfin, l'essai conclut sur la proposition de Diagne d'"incliner sans nécessiter", soulignant l'importance de reconnaître la diversité linguistique comme une richesse et de pratiquer la traduction avec respect pour les différentes cultures et langues.
